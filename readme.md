Placemod (Fast Schematic Spawning System) for Minecraft
Author Ternsip

Placemod adds new extraordinary very optimized and fast structure generator in the world. 
It spawns different structures based on schematics in the world on the server side. 
During the world exploration you can find various discoveries neatly generated from schematics. 
Produced structures can reach gigantic proportions, since schematics is not limited by size.
Any user can add arbitrary schematic to make it possible automatically appear in the world. 
Mod config provides the ability to adjust spawn rate. It is possible to generate villages constructed from schematic sets. 
I have collected more than 800+ great schematics and include them to standard mod releases.
